        <h2>If it weren't for Edie Windsor, two amazing things in my life would not have happened. I would have never been able to get legally married in the US, and I would have never been able to attend a bootcamp so that I could learn how to code. My life would have been drastically different than it is today as a happily married mother of two who gets to pursue her love of problem-solving and passion for working toward equity in tech spaces.</h2>
